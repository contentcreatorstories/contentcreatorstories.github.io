## Featured Guest: Rubhen925
_______________________

Rubhen925 is a fantastic Youtube creator who creates series on a variety of video games, including: Persona 5 Royal, Final Fantasy 7, Animal Crossing, and more. Check out his interview below!


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

I’m Rubhen, a Video Game Development and Design Student. Well I just recently finished my college. But due to the corona panic I’m awaiting my graduation. I’m in the process of making game prototypes and applying for a video game programming job in the video game industry.

I mainly create walkthrough videos of upcoming and new games, along with guides for people stuck with certain elements in games such as puzzles, locations of collectibles, trophies/achievements, etc. I used to do reviews as well. The walkthrough videos are now my staple as I do my best to edit out downtime in the videos such as load times, numerous fails, and streamline the content so people can enjoy it without feeling bored.

## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

I was a trophy hunting fanatic on PS4 back when I got my PS4. I was hunting them like crazy and would love to compete to try and be the first to get Platinum trophies. I was successful with many but was fine with top 5 or top 10 on a list as well. During one of these hunts I was able to get an early copy of Bloodborne. I was sharing my impressions of the game with no spoilers in forums and they encouraged me to make boss guides as videos since the game was hard for many.

I used the PS4 capture feature to make some basic videos which actually became a hit during launch of the game. That’s how my channel started, but after covering Bloodborne I went back to my Grad studies in University. I came back to fully work on the channel in 2017 when Nioh and Persona 5 came out. I made tons of guides and trophy videos which then boosted my channel’s standings. From there I decided to carry on with making regular videos for the channel.

## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube.
________________________________________________________________________________

The first video was painful for me as I didn’t know what I was doing. The recording was a failure as I messed up with the share button on the PS4 2-3 times. Since I didn’t have any capture cards the share feature was my only option. But after watching a couple video tutorials back in 2015 I flubbed my way through using the Sharefactory to make one video. This process took about 3 hours. The video was only like 10 mins, but for an inexperienced person this was the best outcome at that time.

Uploading to YT was simple as the PS4 share feature took care of that. That was the simplest part so I kind of lucked out there.




## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

This is a bit tricky to answer as I didn’t really do much since my first set of videos. I uploaded a video here and there from 2015 to the start of 2017. So my channel had no way of growing. But with some advice from a friend I decided to cover Nioh as I was the first one to get the Platinum Trophy for the game. I made some basic guides for builds, and boss videos which were popular for my channel at the time.
But right after that, Persona 5 came out in the West. Many people struggled with the trophies and mechanics, so I ended up collaborating with an online friend in a forum to make a written trophy guide. This was an excellent way to showcase my trophy guide videos which gained popularity through the written guide.

I then continued to make more gameplay and trophy guide videos for other new and upcoming games, which were then featured in written trophy guides on multiple forums. This was what helped boost my channel’s followers.

But I kind of stopped the hunt for trophies and platinums as I just wanted to enjoy the game experiences. Some trophy hunts were a pure grind and can make it a sour experience. Since stopping my trophy hunts I decided to make walkthrough videos which have become a staple now on my channel.


## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

Yes. I would have kept making more videos during my 2 year hiatus on the channel from 2015 to 2017. There were so many games I played which I could have covered, but I ended up not doing anything. Call it laziness, but for me I was content just playing them as the process of making videos were tiresome when using Sharefactory. Looking back I should have invested the time to make the videos instead of hunting trophies in games that required too much grind.



## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

Right now my channel just reached 65 000 subscribers which is huge for me. It’s been a phenomenal 3 years since I fully started focusing on the channel in 2017. Went from 100 subscribers to 65k. It’s like a dream, but the channel now has a certain level of expectation from some of my hardcore subscribers who want the latest games to be covered. I’ve also started streaming on YouTube to connect with my community.

My goal is to make it to 100K and to try and get the Verified check mark for my channel. I’ve been working hard to reach there. But YouTube now is saturated with game channels, so it’s an uphill battle to reach there. Thankfully I don’t have to do it alone. I’ve made some friends with other similar channels and even channels that have millions of subs. So with the help of my subscribers, friends, and family I’m sure I’ll reach 100k sometime in the future :)




## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

I use Elgato HD 60S for recording games on consoles, along with PC games. Streamlabs OBS is used for streaming games to YouTube, and Adobe Premiere Pro is used for video editing.

Other than that I do use Audactiy for vocal audio recordings. In terms of tools for the channel, I use TubeBuddy to see my rankings, analytics, and also keywords for tagging.



## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

I haven’t used any books or podcasts. My most influential website is GOOGLE. Any question you may have, just googling it will most likely answer it. I’ve been stuck many times in the past and googling my problem has always had the answer. So I implore more people to check with google first :)


## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

This is a tough one. Due to the saturated nature of gaming channels sprouting everyday on YouTube, it will be tough for anyone new. What worked for me was always branching out and covering new games. With new gameplay videos or guides. Also since many bigger channels have the advantage of getting games early from review copies, they will have full game walkthroughs and guides for new games on launch day or embargo. This gives them a huge advantage which newcomers cannot compete with.

It’s the harsh truth but unless you receive an early copy. post on launch day, or already have a big following from other social media platforms such as IG, Twitter, or streaming platforms like Twitch and Mixer, it might be hard to get any traction. I’m glad I started a couple years ago as starting now would have been incredibly hard to grow a new channel.

My advice is post games you’re passionate about regularly. Once a day or once every other day. Don’t cover games you’re not into as the gameplay will show your lack of enthusiasm and the viewers will know just by watching. Stream a couple times during the week to communicate with your community and keep them engaged. But the biggest thing will be to cover new games during the first couple days of launch, as that’s the best way of getting an influx of new viewers into your channel.



## Where can we go to learn more?
_________________________________

YouTube itself has a great help section to learn about posting videos, rules, etc. As mentioned before GOOGLE is a great search engine that will answer many of your questions. But Reddit is also a great place where smaller youtubers gather as a community to help each other more. One of the best places to go when starting out!
