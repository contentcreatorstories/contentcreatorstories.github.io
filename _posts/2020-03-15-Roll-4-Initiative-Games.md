## Channel Name - Niche
_______________________

Roll 4 Initiative - Games


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

Ryan: We’re geeks! We wanted to make videos about the games we play; mostly TTRPGs (table top role playing games) like Dungeons and Dragons, Shadowrun, Pathfinder, FATE, things like that. From there it grew out to other areas: Books, movies, video games. I do a series specifically on Monsters to use in games, Dawn has a regular GM (game master) diary where she talks about the game she is running and offer tips for others GMs.
We’ve started doing interviews with other creators as well, and making a series that teaches people how to play different board games.

Dawn: Like Ryan said, we’re geeks. I’ve been playing board games since I was a kid, play the occasional video game, and have gotten into TTRPGs as an adult. We began making videos about TTRPGs, Ryan has been playing for years and I recently was introduced and fell in love with that form of gaming. Over the years have expanded it to include just about all of our geeky interests (maybe someday I’ll even make a knitting video…)
We have a number of series on specific topics, monsters, game master diary & tips, teaching board games, and a few more.

## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

Ryan: Our very first video was because Geek & Sundry was doing a submission call for new shows. It was during the height of the TableTop, The Guild/Felicia Day popularity, and we were really hoping to get picked up. We didn’t! But, we kept making videos in our spare time and having fun it it.

Dawn: We made our first video as a submission to Geek & Sundry’s vlogger search. While we didn’t get picked up, I enjoyed the process and found it to be a great creative outlet and enjoyed the feedback and little community I found online. I had recently made the switch from working in theatre to television, so it was also a great way for me to learn and practice professional skills.



## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube.
________________________________________________________________________________

Ryan: I recently went back and re-watched it. At the time we really tried to bring what we were familiar with (We both work in the film/stage/TV industry) and make it more than just a camera in our living room. But… well it was pretty much just our camera in our living room!


Dawn: We chatted through what the video would be. Spent some time setting up equipment and making adjustments. And then just hit record. I was really nervous, Ryan helped point out that if I screwed up at any point I could just edit it out and that relaxed me. Once the video was filmed I used a really basic editing software (I think it was Movie Magic since at the time I had a PC) and cut out all the empty pauses and stuttering. Uploading took a few hours, i think I even had to do it a second time because of formatting issues. And then it was up and we were just waiting to see what people thought.



## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

Ryan: For me it’s about consistency and outreach. We have a much more regular release schedule now (Tuesdays and Thursdays) and we interact with folks as much as we can. I guess, I mean online a lot. It’s turned in to another job for sure, and I guess I’m the ‘Social Media manager’ for the company?
And it isn’t just about numbers, we’re more engaged with colleagues and fans because it’s fun! But yes, there’s always that thing where you’re driving to get more Subs.


 Dawn: Consistency is a big thing. Now that we’ve stuck with a set schedule I’ve noticed a more steady climb. I’ve also tried to be active in a number of online groups, contributing both our content and commenting on other people’s posts. I also try to stay engaged with our community, responding thoughtfully to as many comments as quickly as I can. We’re just starting to reach out and do more collaborations, I have a feeling that will help us grow a little faster.

## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

Ryan: That’s always so tough. I mean, “Do it better”? Our first goal was to get picked up by a bigger channel. And to be perfectly honest of course we still would like that to happen. But for me it’s more about focusing on what we’re doing now and what we can do next.


 Dawn: I’d have reached out to some more fellow videomakers earlier about doing collaborations. Other than that, there are a bunch of little tweaks and adjustments but most are things I’ve just learned through doing.



## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

Ryan: Right now we’re pretty much a part time production company. We film 2-4 days a week, we’re out in out (online) community as well as real community, working with local games stores and things like that. We’re trying to build our following and patrons. It’s not a secret that we’d like this to become our “Real Job”. At least for me, it would be feasible to be able to do this full time once we reach a certain earnings point. That would mean more videos, more events, more stuff… That’s what I want.


 Dawn: I’d really like to see our little company support itself and hopefully be feasible income for at least one of us. We have ideas for merch and more that I’d like to see out in the world at some point. I’d like to begin to invest in some better editing software to make that process easier and allow us to do some things in videos we just don’t have the capability for now.


## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

Ryan: Dawn knows this a lot better than I do. Or, the specifics. We are on YouTube, we have an Insta and Reddit and Facebook and Twitter, of course. Recently for online sessions we found ZOOM to work really well.
Equipment wise We have a DSLR and another smaller camera, and a GoPro that we were just given by a fan from another channel.


 Dawn: Ok equipment: we currently use a Canon Rebel t6i with a Rode mic for most filming. We also have a Canon VIXIA that some of our older videos were filmed on and that we still use as a second camera from time to time. Out and about we also use our iphones to film and take pictures. I edit using iMovie on my Macbook. I use Pixlr for thumbnails, photos editing, and sometimes to create video elements. A lot of what we’ve done so far is work with what we had and have slowly been investing in better equipment to up quality and make the process easier.
Currently we’re using Asana to track our schedule and to-do list. I’ve used both IFTT and Hootsuite in the past to help manage social media but we’ve pretty much stopped using both because I’ve felt like we lose the personal interaction a bit with those tools.

## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

Ryan: Well TableTop, Wil Wheaton’s show, is what got us started. From there I’d say that the biggest influences are SciShow and Critical Role. SciShow for me just helped to prove that YouTube and online in general was a place where geeky voices could be heard, and was an avenue for work.
Critical Role is maybe the most popular show right now in the TTRPG community, so of course that’s an inspiration. It’s a high production value, great characters, and it’s done by people who seem really genuine and honest in their love of the game and of the community.


 Dawn: Geek & Sundry is the first that comes to mind, both as getting us started and inspiration. From Critical Role, to TableTop, to a number of their vloggers.
The Vlogbrothers and a lot of Complexly’s productions have been a great source of learning about online video and a big impact on my style.
I cannot stress how much Amanda Palmer’s TEDtalk “The Art of Asking” and her book by the same title has affected my attitude and relationship with being a creator. I think every artist and creator should read her book, especially if you are considering crowdfunding.


## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

Ryan: From me? I think it’s sounds a bit in-opposition, but first off just start making stuff. But, then do your homework. There’s a lot of things to learn about camera set-up, lighting, sound, editing… And there are a lot of resources out there if you just look for them and learn from others.


 Dawn: Be yourself and make stuff you enjoy. It’s perfectly okay to be inspired by other people, but try to find ways to make it your own. Cause if you are enjoying it and being yourself, eventually your audience will find you. And don’t be afraid to change. Change your format. Change your content. Keep playing around until you find the thing that works, both for you and your audience.
Also, don’t be afraid to ask people to look at your content. Whether it’s asking an IRL friend or posting to a forum (make sure you’re following forum guidelines) It’s okay to be proud of your work.
