## Channel Name - Niche
_______________________

XanYT - Funny


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

I am a 16 year old who likes to have fun and make others happy while doing so. I make reaction video to the latest trends, as well as my passion, basketball videos. I tend to make videos my subscribers want to see.


## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

I was tired of living normal, boring life. I knew I wanted to do YouTube because of the joy it brought other people and I decided to seize the opportunity and start my channel.


## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube.
________________________________________________________________________________

As soon as I had the video idea (which took my days to think about), I just went with it. I grabbed my mom’s camera, went in my room, and after about an hour, I finally had a five minute video! Uploading it to YouTube was a different story. After editing, I was scared to upload because I didn’t know how people would react to it. But i’d never know, if I hadn’t tried.



## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

Promoting and giving the people what they want! In all honesty, a lot of my subscribers came from doing a giveaway on my channel. I think doing this let people know that I was serious about YouTube and they are still subscribed to to this day.

## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

If I could go back, I wouldn’t have started my channel off doing reaction videos. I am just now transitioning into making videos of my own that I, one day, would want people to react to.


## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

As for my channel, I am currently just above 450 subscribers. I feel like my channel has potential to change lives so I will give everything I have to making sure my channel is successful. By the end of the year I plan on having 2000+ subscribers and that is because I plan on getting better equipment and putting out more videos that people want to see.


## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

All the tools I use are the following:
- IPhone 6s - Recording
- Cheap light stands
- Tripod
- IMovie - Editing



## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

The most influential for my channel would be Reddit because it has allowed me to share my ideas with people who, otherwise, would never have seen my channel.

## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

Just do it! YouTube is hard work and it’ll never work out if you never authentically give everything you have to making videos. My hardest video was the first one, after that, it was all uphill. Also, don’t be discouraged in the beginning when you realize you’re not growing as fast as you want. Keep striving and MAKE people want to watch your videos.
