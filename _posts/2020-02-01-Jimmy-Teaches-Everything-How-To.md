Jimmy Teaches Everything - How To


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

I’m Jimmy Murray from Jimmy Teaches Everything. I create “How-To” videos on virtually everything. My favorite is the video on the fast part of Eminem’s Rap God.


## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

When I was in high school, I had this idea that I was funny, so I did the normal high school kid things of performing at stand-up, improv, and sketch comedy clubs, you know, while the nerds were partying or whatever. I never had the free time to pursue YouTube, but when I moved and didn’t have a job, that was the time to strike.


## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube.
________________________________________________________________________________

It sucked. I live in a two-bedroom apartment without any carpet, so I had to soundproof a tiny area without interfering with my roommate’s office or violating our lease. Nothing would frame right. Eventually, I threw my hands up in the air and pressed “Record.” I found my improv skills lacking, so I spent two solid hours memorizing what needed to happen. I put my head down and pushed through. It was great.


## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

It’s all word of mouth! I find my blogs, tweets, podcasts, and YouTube shows all feed into each other. That strategy worked really well for me.


## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

Start in 2006.


## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

I’m doing a lot of voice work for other people now. I’m currently filming a huge backlog to release daily.


## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

Everything I do is in MoviePy, a library for Python, which is a coding language.


## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

Probably THE WADS YouTube channel. We live by each other and have the same sense of humor.


## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

Make yourself make something every day, even it’s just the idea or a script for a YouTube episode. You’re not gonna make money anytime soon unless you get insanely lucky. Use free tools and art until you can afford the better stuff. Surround yourself with positive people. There’s room for everyone. Find your niche and run with it.
