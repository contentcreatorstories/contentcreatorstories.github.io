Dave McKeegan - Photography


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

My name is Dave McKeegan, I am a photographer / videographer which is what I produce videos about.


## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

I started in photo / video about 10 years ago, and what began as a hobby grew into my big passion. I have watched other photography based YouTube channels for several years, often using them to learn new skills or find out information on new equipment. I always enjoy engaging in discussions about photography gear etc so about 6 months ago I decided rather than just watching other peoples content, I would start producing my own.



## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube.
________________________________________________________________________________

My first video was pretty lacklustre, I recorded it about 3 separate times before I got a look I was happy with. The actual filming process was fairly straight forward, I also included some screen capture footage from my computer, that whole process and uploading it to YouTube I found very easy, the bigger challenge I found (and what I have been improving in subsequent videos) is the lighting and also coming across
more energetic in the videos as well.


## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

Honestly very little in the grand scheme of things, most of my growth has been organic from YouTube. I was quite fortunate that soon after starting my videos, a new camera lens was announced that I quickly bought with the sole intention of creating a YouTube review of, and rather luckily I was seemingly the only person on the planet who bothered to do so because even now there are very few videos for this lens online, as a result that video produced quite a lot of traffic to my channel and basically gave the whole thing a bit of a jump start, so within the first month or so my channel was already up over the 1K subscribers mark.

## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

Hindsight is a wonderful thing, obviously I could say now looking back that I wish my earlier videos were more of the quality that my current ones are, or that I wish I'd focused more on the videos that turned out to be very popular ... or that I had started doing this 10 years ago before everyone else.

However, in all honesty, I don't think there is really much I would want to change, I certainly don't regret anything I have done so far, it has allowed me to grow and create the content that I make today.


## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

Currently my time is split between freelance work and YouTube. Ideally I would be to be in a position where I can rely on the revenue from my content to allow me to do it full time, however that will require a much larger following than I currently have so for now I will continue what I am doing to grow my audience.


## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

My YouTube is basically running itself, I do have Facebook & Instagram however they are more about showing off the finished images rather than the gear and techniques behind them. I am actually finding that my YouTube channel is sending people to my other pages rather than the other way around.

## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

I would say my biggest influence is from watching Peter McKinnon's YouTube channel, the content that he produces is frankly mesmerising and my goal is to one day be able to produce content of a similar level.


## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

Most people don't realize just how much potential YouTube has if you can get a foot on the ladder, the people around you may well question if it worth your time and effort making content .... the simple answer is YES!
