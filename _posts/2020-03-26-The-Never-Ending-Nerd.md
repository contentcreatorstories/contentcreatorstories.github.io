## Channel Name - Niche
_______________________

The Never Ending Nerd - Learning


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

My name is scot, aka The Never Ending Nerd. Most of my videos revolve around me trying to learn a new skill in each video. The catch is that each skill is something you'd see in a video game, like picking locks with bobby pins, trying to carry multiple weapons around on your back, jogging forever, learning to double jump, the list is endless.

The other videos I produce revolve around me trying to become the best version of me that I possibly can. A good portion of what I try to learn is physical in nature, whether it's learning to shoot a bow, or rock climb, I need to be in shape for it, and I need to be able to rest and recover from it. So that's what those videos are about, how I basically train to learn new skills, and also how I motivate myself, and manage my time so I can effectively run this channel.

## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

Growing up I was that kid who played too many video games, and watched too many action movies. I was the one who would be trying to build forts in the woods, or makeshift ninja stars. I'd always see stuff from video games or movies and think, "wow, wouldn't that be cool to do in real life." I just never grew out of that feeling. It wasn't till I went to college and actually started watching youtube more that the light bulb in my head went off and I realized that making youtube videos might just be the excuse I need to actually try and learn some of the crazy stuff I want to do.

The other reason was that I wanted a way to escape from a boring life. During college my day to day life was very monotonous, it was awful. Once I graduated and started making videos, I told myself that no matter what I would not have a boring life, and I think that's also the sentiment I try to convey to viewers, that no matter who you are, you can do things to make your life closer to the fantasy you want it to be, and that you can truly be the hero of your own story.



## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube.
________________________________________________________________________________

It was very choppy and poorly planned. My first video was about whether or not you could pick a lock the same way you could in the fallout games (go watch the video for the answer). I first came up with the idea, wrote a script of it, then tried my best to get everything on film with the camera on my galaxy s8, I didn't even use a mic, I just used the sound off of the phone video. Then I haphazardly edited everything together in Davinci Resolve. Back then I was still using Snappa to do all of my thumbnails, and it shows.

Now my process is much more planned out, the steps are mostly the same, I come up with an idea, write an outline for it going over how I want the video to be structured, then I write a script, film the intro, film the main segments, then film the outro and any other miscellaneous footage. The biggest difference comes in my editing. Now I use better mics, and make sure my sound is regulated and I have noise reduction, I also make sure my editing is more fluid and the story flows along at a good pace. I also use paint.net for all of my thumbnails, for being a free photo editor it gets the job done and more.




## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

Aside from trying to upload new, entertaining videos as regularly as I can, I'd say the two biggest things I've been doing to help grow my channel have been: improving my editing skills, and increasing my social media presence.

Improving how my videos look and sound is so important to me, because I know if a video doesn't sound good it'll be the first reason I stop watching it, and if a video looks good, there's a higher chance I'll watch to the end. So I try to keep those two things in mind each time I film and edit, and I think it's helped elevate some of my videos and gained me views.

Social media, while I'm god awful at self promotion, has definitely gotten me views and subscribers. I try to post to three platforms each day, Instagram, reddit, and rizzle, with each one I try to either post a link to and old video, mention my channel, or post photos/updates on videos I'm currently making.


## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

If there's one thing I would do differently, it would be to skip over the short phase right when I started, where I thought I wanted to do a lets play channel.I only did it for a month, and I quickly realized lets plays were not my cup of tea, they're fun to watch, not that fun to produce. I would be nice to be able to get that solid month of time and work back, and use it to focus on what I'm doing now.




## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

Right now, I'm just past the 50 sub mark. My channel is having slow, but steady growth, and I can only hope it continues. As of now I'm doing my best to make more content, and to start batch production so I can build up an inventory of videos which would allow me to upload more regularly.

Aside form that I'm working on some really cool videos that I can't wait to finish up and upload.


## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

VidIQ is the one extension I use the most. So far it's been super helpful with allowing me to keep track of views, and it makes editing tags super fast.

As far as free tools that I use for editing, then it's Davinci Resolve 15 for all my video editing, Audacity for my sound editing, and paint.net for thumbnails. All of these are free to download, and are professional grade.


## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

The most influential book I've read, was Do The Work. It's only about 70 pages, but it goes over each step of the creative process from the point of resistance. It's well worth the read.
I also watch certain other cigar box guitar builders/players on YouTube such as Shane Speal, Justin Johnson, ChickenboneJohn.  All worth watching!


## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

Stop thinking about doing it, and just do it. Create as much as you can, and try to learn as much as you can.
