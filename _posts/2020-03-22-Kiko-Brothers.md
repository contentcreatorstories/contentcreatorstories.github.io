## Channel Name - Niche
_______________________

KikoBrothers - Japan


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

KikoBrothers consists of me (Kiko) and sometimes my brother (Jerry). In short, my channel relates either to Japan or Japanese Anime. I currently have 8k subscribers and I experiment with various types of video. I don't do Anime reviews, what I have done is interviews, games, unboxings, vlogs and lists (all related to Japan / Anime).

## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

Throughout high school I really enjoyed entertaining the people around me, especially through humor and breakdancing. Then, in 2009, I started to film myself dancing. I uploaded those videos and bunch of other random videos (all raw videos with no editing) to YouTube for the purpose of sharing them with my friends and family.


## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube.
________________________________________________________________________________

For my KikoBrothers channel, I started using iMovie to upload simple slideshow videos with only pictures and music. There wasn’t much of a process since I was just experimenting with the program’s tools. I eventually upgraded to Final Cut Pro so I can learn more about advanced editing, and I am currently still learning.



## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

When I first started uploading videos (to my KikoBrothers channel) I didn’t do anything, I didn’t share videos with anyone, not even my friends or family. All I did was experiment with those videos so I can improve my editing. Then, one day, I noticed that one of my videos hit 30k views out of nowhere. At that point I started to dedicate myself to this channel. I actually recently started to become more active on Instagram, Twitter and Reddit so I can grow my following.


## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

Yes. I would have taken YouTube more seriously when I started uploading in 2009 instead of right now. There is so much experience I could have learned in those years.




## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

I am actually pretty happy with how my videos are turning out. I definitely don’t have a “niche” and my videos are all over the place but I am ok with that (although I do make sure all my videos either relate to Japan or Anime). My goal has always been to have fun and make memories through my videos. For the future, I plan to work in Japan so I can study more Japanese and of course make more Japan-related videos.



## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

I use Final Cut Pro for all my video editing. I haven’t used any other programs or tools. I only recently started sharing my channel on other social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit.



## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

Well since my channel is Japan / Anime theme, I have to say that anything new I learn about Japan or Anime influences me. These past couple days I have been watching “One Piece”, so most likely my newer videos will be about “One Piece”. Now if I learn something new about Japan through my Japanese friends, then my videos will be about Japan. It just all depends.


## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

Yeah! Don’t expect views and subscribers right away, don’t even expect views and subscribers in the first year. Success takes time and work, just keep going and don’t give up. Nothing comes easy after all.


## Where can we go to learn more?
