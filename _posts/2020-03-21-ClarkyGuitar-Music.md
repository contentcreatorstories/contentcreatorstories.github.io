## Channel Name - Niche
_______________________

ClarkyGuitar - Music


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

My name is Justin Clark, and I make guitar related videos, mainly covers using a cigar box guitar, but I also play regular guitar too.  I also do 1 minute guitar tutorials and have videos showing how I build a cigar box guitar.

## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

I started making cigar box guitars in 2012 and decided that the best way to show them was on YouTube.  So I started uploading short videos to show them off and it spiralled from there.



## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube.
________________________________________________________________________________

I remember it clearly, August 2012, I was nervous, had just finished building my first guitar, and all I had was my smart phone to film on.  So I pointed the phone at me in my bedroom and just went for it.  I had a YouTube account long before this so just tried to upload it and it was successful.  To this day it only has around 300 views but it was a positive experience.





## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

I kept just making guitars and doing 1-2 minute demos, just casually up until around a year ago, when I suddenly decided I fancied doing proper guitar covers.  I started with standard guitar covers then thought it would be fun and different to cover rock and metal songs on a cigar box guitar, which are usually used for traditional blues music.  Then I started the 1 minute guitar lessons and recently the videos on how to make a guitar.  I’ve kept trying to better the quality of the videos and branch out, hoping to gain a bit more exposure.  I didn’t have any subscribers a year ago and now have 181 and it is slowly growing.


## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

I don’t think I would.  It’s all a learning process, and I’m still learning.  I always think that the only way to learn is to dive in head first and make mistakes.




## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

I’m at the stage where my channel is growing slowly, but I don’t have any intention to monetize my videos.  I’m quite happy to gain a few subscribers and views and keep putting out content.  I have tonnes of ideas and see it as a great hobby.



## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

I use PowerDirector on my phone to edit videos, I use Canva.com to create my thumbnails and in-video pictures.  I also share my videos on facebook, reddit and to a website called http://www.cigarboxnation.com/



## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

http://www.cigarboxnation.com/ is the main source of inspiration for me.  It has everything you need for a cigar box guitar builder, plans, information, forums and also allows you to share YouTube videos.
I also watch certain other cigar box guitar builders/players on YouTube such as Shane Speal, Justin Johnson, ChickenboneJohn.  All worth watching!


## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

I would say don’t hesitate, dive in head first, learn from your mistakes and don’t get ahead of yourself.  Don’t expect instant success and don’t sweat over views and subscribers.  Do your best and share your videos, and interact with your viewers as much as possible.  Most of all, have fun doing it!
