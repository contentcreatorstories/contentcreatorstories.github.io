## Channel Name - Niche
_______________________

Nama Japan - Japan


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

My name is Sebastian, a German in his early 30s who is currently in Japan for the third time and this time I am going to stay long-term. I create videos about Japan and vlogs about my life in Japan.

## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

I was searching for a new hobby that I could use to combine my love for Japan, brings me out of the house and actually creates something tangible compared to other hobbies like playing games or watching movies and such.

I run a couple of websites, so I was thinking about a blog or a Japan related website in conjunction with photography, but I felt burnt out by the content creation process (i.e. writing Google friendly texts).

As I recently started watching more youtubers and vloggers, I started to think “hey, I’m an outgoing guy, why don’t I try that?” and got myself some basic equipment.




## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube.
________________________________________________________________________________

My first video was a simple, uncut self-introduction video, more or less to try my equipment for the first time and to see how comfortable I feel talking into a camera. After I while I started experimenting with video editing software and finally settled on Shotcut. Uploading itself was kinda smooth as I knew the basics about keywords and SEO. I also had Tubebuddy installed which is a great tool and guide, especially for beginners.





## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

I maintain semi-active Twitter and Facebook presences and a very active Instagram presence. In addition to that I post my content to relevant subreddits on reddit. I also comment a lot on other related videos on Youtube.


## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

I followed the doctrine “if you are not embarrassed of the first thing you create, you waited for too long”, so I guess not really. I do it for fun and to learn about how video editing and Youtube works, so every “bad” video or failure is a learning step.




## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

I currently have around 60 subscribers and gaining another one every other day. I am trying to bring more consistency into my uploading schedule while trying to balance high-effort videos about topics (lots of editing) and more rough, sometimes uncut vlogs.



## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

Shotcut for video editing, Tubebuddy on Youtube itself.

## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

My role models would be the guys from ADVChina, Matthew Tye and Winston Sterzel. I really like their style and their high-quality videos, as well as the more casual videos. I love how they turned their passion into their full time jobs and even made real documentaries in the end. I also like Chris Broad from Abroad in Japan. Just an overall funny guy and good video editing skills.


## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

Just do it! What could possibly happen?
But you will need patience and keep at it. You are probably going to be one of the 99% of the Youtubers which don’t have a video go viral anytime soon.


## Where can we go to learn more?
_________________________________

There are tons of resources these days for aspiring video creators. If you search long enough you will probably even find content for video creators specifically for your niche. For example about every vlogger or video creator in Japan has one or several videos explaining their equipment, the tools they use and their video creating process. Just open your eyes! …and use Google.
