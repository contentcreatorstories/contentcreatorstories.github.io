## Channel Name - Niche
_______________________

Zepherus - History


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

My channel is called ‘Zepherus’ and I make videos on little-known but interesting historical and scientific ‘stuff’.

## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

The urge to start making videos sort of spawned from the want to share cool and interesting facts and stories, which I liked to do in real life (as you can tell, I have lots of friends). YouTube is a pretty effective tool at doing that on a large scale, so it seemed a natural progression.

I keep my ‘personal backstory’ (face/name/life/etc) secret though - it’s not really relevant/important to anything I do, and people are only really interested because I keep it a secret.



## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube.
________________________________________________________________________________

The first video I made when I became serious about the whole ‘YouTubing’ thing - made in the style I actively pursue now - was made by reading a script in one take whilst screen-capturing a powerpoint at the same time. It was made in about an hour, and it was absolutely terrible.
Three years and 149,000 subscribers later, I am happy to report I have progressed a lot since then




## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

Well, I’ve gotten better - this sounds like a cop-out answer to the question, but it’s the most honest one I can give. I haven’t really promoted anywhere or done much to grow other than focus on improving the actual content itself - scripts that are vastly more detailed and that take months rather than minutes to research and write, professional audio and video editing softwares (and the knowledge of how to use them), and most importantly years and years of learning from mistakes and practice at narrating, editing, and uploading videos.


## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

Not really - there are quite a few large errors I have made in the past, but on reflection I’m glad I made them because I learned from them and never made that mistake again.




## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

As of the 10th May 2018, I have 149,229 subscribers and 8,211,000 views.

I have very little plans for the future other than to keep improving and making more content.
I suppose hitting 200k would also be nice.



## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

Internet/libraries for research, Google Docs for scriptwriting, Audacity for audio and Adobe Premiere Pro / After Effects for the visuals.

I have a few accounts for the channel on other platforms (Twitter, Reddit, Discord) but don’t use them much.  


## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

Starting off, other educational content creators like CGP Grey were the main source of influence and inspiration, but as the years have gone on I have found that there is nobody like that I can really point to anymore - CGP Grey is still fantastic, don’t get me wrong - but I’ve found I’m looking more to myself and past experience rather than to others to decide what to do next.
I’m not doing a cheap imitation of someone else anymore, as you could probably have said about me three years ago - I’m doing my own thing.


## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

Do something you enjoy - many people go into it wanting to make money or make it their job, but if you do this you won’t have the stamina to make it through to if your channel takes off, and even then you probably won’t want to do it as a job if you hate it.

If you make the act of making the videos the reward and not anything else, then whatever happens you’ll gain something, and if it takes off then that’ll be a nice bonus.

You’ll also keep at it longer if you enjoy it, gaining more experience and getting better as you do so - leading into my second point….

PRACTICE

Your first video will be terrible and likelihood is you’ll hate it for the rest of time, because you’ll make a lot of errors that someone just starting out will inevitably make.

Don’t be deterred by this though - note these potential improvements and make another video. Make it better than the first. Make the third better than the second. Keep improving, as only practice can allow. You will get there.

You have an ocean of ways to improve, and as long as you make videos you’ll never stop learning new ways to make your content better.


## Where can we go to learn more?
_________________________________

I suppose if you are really interested you could check out my channel. I don’t particularly talk informally in the videos but you can contact me via text on there if for some reason you’d like to ask me about something I have said.
