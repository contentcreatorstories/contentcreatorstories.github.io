Dustin Abbott - Photography


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

My name is Dustin Abbott, and I make photography-themed videos.  The majority of them are gear reviews, with an occasional tutorial thrown in.


## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________


I initially did text-only reviews for my website, www.dustinabbott.net (along with some other publications), but there was something that wasn’t possible to describe; you needed to see it.  I created a channel and uploaded a very brief video in January of 2014 that demonstrated the focus speed on a lens.  I actually didn’t create another video for several months, but at some point I realized that creating video reviews was a way of leveraging the work I was already doing in my reviews and reaching a separate audience with them.  At first those videos were fairly few and far between, but, after about nine months, I started creating them more regularly.


## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

I learned along the way how to properly keyword my videos and to leverage my social media connections to get the word out on my videos.  I work very hard at connecting the various places I share my work, from photos to videos to my reviews.  I’ve built brand relationships, retail relationships, and other influencer relationships to help grow my brand.


## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

At some point I started to get a lot of invitations to join various networks.  I eventually agreed to join one, but mostly regretted it and left after my six month contract was over.  I had hoped that the network would really help promote and grow my channel, but that wasn’t really the case.  I mostly gave them part of my earnings and was still left to do the vast majority of the work to grow the channel.


## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

I’ve been working to develop my own unique review style and to find the format that works best for me.  You can’t take everyone’s feedback, as it is all conflicting; you have to find what works for you.  I’ve learned to use YouTube’s community tools to connect with my audience and get feedback at times when I’m not sure how to approach a video.  I’ve currently got a little over 41,000 subscribers, and would really like to grow to at least 100,000.  My growth to this point has been steady, but I’ve never had a meteoric rise.  I’d love to see a breakthrough where I add a lot of new subscribers over a brief period, but I also know that the followers I have are pretty loyal.


## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

I use Bitly a lot to customize my links, and then share my content across a number of social media platforms to help drive views.  Some of them can also be useful places to connect with the brands of the gear I work with.  I have a lot of partners that help not only in providing me gear for review, but also in helping spread the word about my reviews.


## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

For me, the most helpful/influential players have been some of the brands and retailers that I work with.  I have a strategic partnership with B&H Photo, PhotoNews Canada, Zeiss USA, along with the distributors for the brands Sigma, Tamron, Laowa, and more.  I’m just beginning a new partnership with Canon Canada, too.  Most of these brands have helped by utilizing their own social media platforms to help spread the word on my reviews.  Early on my association with CanonRumors.com was a huge asset in driving views, and, while my personal influence has now grown, CR is still a asset to helping get content out there.


## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

Two things:  1)  Learn how to properly brand your content and utilize keywords, titles, SEO, and social media to help your content stand out.  There is a TON of content on YouTube, and you’ve got to find a way to make your content stand out from the crowd.  2)  It’s all in who you know.  Keep your eyes open for potential strategic partnerships.  Sometimes you have to be willing to make the extra effort in the early stages and not receive fair compensation for your work in order to build your brand.  It’s also important to value your work, however, and learn the right points to not work for free and start to assign value to what you do.
