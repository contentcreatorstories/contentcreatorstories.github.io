## Channel Name - Niche
_______________________

Totemworlds - Music/Art


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

My name is Katan, I’m from Acapulco, Mexico and I make unconventional music and art videos.


## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

I started about 3 years ago. I had just released my debut album “Stuga Bloodstoner,” and I always envisioned it as a visual album so I decided to create a video for each song. When connected, the videos tell a story that relates to some spiritual experiences I had while backpacking in Costa Rica.



## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube.
________________________________________________________________________________

My idea for a video started as a feeling, but I kept going back to it for a few weeks in order to let it take shape. I found that keeping a journal was helpful, the you can see how ideas develop over time. The first pages in my journal entries are strange, filled with doodles and made-up words, but then the language becomes clearer, boxes are drawn: I have a storyboard now which gives me clear direction forward. The rest is just hard work!!!



## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

Connecting with people is important, whether in person or online. I'm also realizing how important it is to market oneself on Youtube.Also taking all opportunities as they come!

## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

Absolutely! I would have picked something less ambitious. I didn't think it would take me an average of 4 months to finish a new video. I wish I could release videos more often, I regret having my viewers wait that long.


## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

My channel is growing more everyday, and this is motivating me to work harder and start collaborating online with people around the world. My goal is to release new music soon, and continue with the visual album ideas I've been working on.


## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

Fiverr for hiring online (I made my logo there for 5$) and Final Cut Pro X for editing video.  



## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

I love everything Youtube, there are so many resources there, it's hard not to find what you’re looking for. I learn so much from Youtube, from reading the Tarot to filming techniques.

## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

The sooner you start the better. I learn a ton of things after I finish a new video. Not just about my technique but also how well the videos are received by my viewers on Youtube. If you're worried your videos suck, remember this: the more videos you make, the more you grow.
