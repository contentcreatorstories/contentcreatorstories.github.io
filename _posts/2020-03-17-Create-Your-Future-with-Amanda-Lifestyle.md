## Channel Name - Niche
_______________________

Create Your Future with Amanda - Lifestyle


## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

I am a life coach and counselor.  I create self-help how-to videos mainly on the subject of positive thinking and the law of attraction.   The main theme I stick to is anything that empowers, inspires and motivates people to love and accept themselves.  


## What’s your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

I have struggled with many things in my life and I used to think so negative about everything.  And at one point early in my life I changed all that after learning about the power of positive thinking through NLP = Neuro-linguistic Programming.  Almost immediately I started to see my dreams come true; so i studied further and so far I have obtained five certificates in this field.
Many people have written self-help books, and I wanted to do something similar to share what “worked for me” however writing is not something I enjoy.  My passion has always been video, public speaking and more visual forms of media.  So sharing my story and tips to help people on Youtube was the perfect fit for me.



## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube.
________________________________________________________________________________

OMG! It was a mess!  It took me forever and I had no idea what I was doing.  Then as I posted more... every video got easier and got better.  Now every video I upload I do something different than the last and push myself to make it better than the last one.



## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
__________________________________________________________________

Marketing, Marketing, Marketing… I tell everyone I meet about my channel.  I have business cards and brochures promoting it.  I promote on Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and Reddit.  I will be starting an email list with Mailchimp in the coming weeks to send out new videos as well.


## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
___________________________________________________________

I should have done more research and learned about all the different platforms eg i only recently learned about Reddit which has been excellent.

## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
_______________________________________________________________

I am at a place where I am excited about making videos for my Youtube channel CREATE YOUR FUTURE WITH AMANDA.  As for the future, I am going to keep doing different things, sharing on different platforms to share my content with the world.  And keep being excited to make the next video - to keep helping others learn to change their life dramatically with positive thought.


## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
___________________________________________________

Right now I use: My cell phone to record videos.  Paint app to create thumbnails and Movie maker to edit them.  Keep in mind I am always looking for better, easier to use tools. ;)


## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
________________________________________________________________________________

I am a avid Youtuber.  There are so many channels I enjoy watching.  I have been influenced by Graveyard girl, Jenna Marbles, Casey Neistat, Shane Dawson and Roman Atwood just to name a few.  I enjoy their vlogs because they are their authentic selves and they share themselves with the world and send a message that it is ok to do you no matter who you are!   


## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
______________________________________________________________________________________

Do not worry about what other people with think.  Avoid delaying in starting your channel because you don’t think that you’re good enough, don’t have the right equipment or whatever.  As you post videos you will find what works and what doesn’t work. Just jump into it and improve your videos from there!
