## Who are you and what videos do you create?
_____________________________________________

I am a custom sneaker creator and make videos of custom shoe creations, usually Jordans or Adidas shoes, and post them on Youtube.

## What's your backstory and how did you decide to start making Youtube videos?
_______________________________________________________________________________

I started out a big sneakerhead, and saw tons of people making really cool custom art, by painting on shoes. I thought it would be cool to make a website where people could order custom shoes, and so I set one up, and started a Youtube channel to show off some of the coolest ones made.

## Describe the process of filming your first video and uploading it to Youtube
______________________________________________________________________________

The first video was pretty bad, I wasn’t sure what the lighting should look like, or even how the script should go. Overtime though you get into a groove, and things get much easier as you get used to filming.

## What have you done to grow your following to where it is today?
_________________________________________________________________

I’ve shared my channel with a lot of friends, and have a link to it on my website. Doing these things really helped my channel grow in the initial stages.

## If you could go back, would you do anything differently?
__________________________________________________________

I would spend more time watching tutorials on how to create good looking videos. There’s a lot of nuances that goes into Youtube videos, and creators who are really good, don’t get the credit they deserve.

## Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?
______________________________________________________________

Right now I’m taking a break from making videos. Eventually I will go back and make more clips of the newest and best custom shoes.

## What platform/tools do you use for your channel?
__________________________________________________

I use iMovie on Mac to splice multiple clips together, as well as free online programs to edit my own openings.

## What’s the most influential books/podcasts/websites for your channel and why?
_______________________________________________________________________________

I’m a big fan of books, some of my favorite influential ones are How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, and Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. Reading these books will give you the motivation to make a successful Youtube channel.

## Advice for other content creators who want to get started or are just starting out?
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Just start. The hardest step is making the first video, and from there everything gets much, much easier.
